# ZLK-mechanism-for-co-orbital-asteroids-of-terrestrial-planets-
A repository for the software developed for the CMDA article Co-orbital asteroids of terrestrial planets affected by the von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism.  We are providing references for three codes:  1) Horizons Earth Orbital Elements Exporter, 2), 3).

1) Horizons Earth Orbital Elements Exporter

This repository contains a Python script that queries NASA’s **JPL Horizons** system for asteroid orbital elements and saves the results to a file called `Particles.el`.
The output format is designed to be simple, precise, and reusable in orbital simulations, numerical experiments, or post-processing pipelines.

## 📌 What This Code Does

- Queries **NASA JPL Horizons** using the `astroquery` library
- Retrieves **Keplerian orbital elements** for a list of asteroids
- Evaluates the elements at a specified **Julian Date**
- Writes the results to a plain-text file (`Particles.el`)
- Preserves high numerical precision suitable for scientific use

## 📂 Files in This Repository

| File | Description |
|----|----|
| `horizons_earth_coorbs.py` | Main Python script that performs the Horizons query and writes output |
| `Particles.el` | Output file generated by the script (created when the script is run) |
| `README.md` | This documentation file |

## 🛰️ Output File Format (`Particles.el`)
The output file has the following structure:  the first line reports the number of asteroids, while the subsequent lines display the Keplerian orbital elements a,e, inc, \Omega,\omega, M.

## 🧰 Requirements

You will need **Python 3.8+** and the following packages:

- `astroquery`
- `astropy`

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install astroquery astropy

An active internet connection is required to query JPL Horizons.

You may wish to modify:

asteroid_ids = ['2025 PN7', '2025 SC', '2025 RB7']
epochs = 2460800.5
Observer location
location = '500@10'  # Earth
Refer to the JPL Horizons documentation for valid object identifiers, locations, and epochs.
